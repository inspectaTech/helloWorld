# helloWorld
my first anything done on github


I wonder if this is my readme text, i guess it is.  so hello.  I don't have anything to say.

bu-but, how can I tell its going into the readMe-edit file if I click on the readMe.md(master) file?
I hope this isn't some more esoteric tech deceptive misdirection stuff.  I get that a lot.
